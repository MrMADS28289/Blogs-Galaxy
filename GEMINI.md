# Gemini Task Log

## Current Task: Dynamic Route Refactoring

**Objective:** Refactor the project to use a single Next.js dynamic route for all category pages instead of individual pages for each category. This will simplify the codebase, reduce redundancy, and make the project more maintainable.

**Plan:**

1.  **Create Dynamic Route File:** Create a new dynamic route file at `src/app/(sub pages)/[category]/page.js`.
2.  **Implement Dynamic Page Logic:** The new page component will:
    *   Receive `params` from Next.js to identify the current category from the URL slug (e.g., 'tech', 'sports').
    *   Import the `BtnList` array from `src/app/data.js`.
    *   Find the full details for the current category (e.g., title: "Tech Galaxy") by matching the URL slug with the data in `BtnList`.
    *   Render the category title dynamically.
    *   Render the `<BlogList>` component, passing the category slug from the URL as a prop.
    *   Pass the shared `<BlogCard>` component to `<BlogList>` as the `ItemLayoutComponent`.
    *   **Integrate 3D Models:** Dynamically import and render the correct 3D model based on the category, using `RenderModel` and the individual model components.
3.  **Verify Navigation:** Check the `link` properties in `src/app/data.js` to ensure they match the new simplified URL structure (e.g., `/tech`, not `/techGalaxy`).
4.  **Cleanup Redundant Files:** After confirming the new dynamic route works correctly, list all the old individual category folders and files and ask for user permission to delete them. This includes:
    *   `src/app/(sub pages)/aiUniverse/`
    *   `src/app/(sub pages)/community/`
    *   `src/app/(sub pages)/creativeCorner/`
    *   `src/app/(sub pages)/geographyNebula/`
    *   `src/app/(sub pages)/historyConstellation/`
    *   `src/app/(sub pages)/motivationMeteor/`
    *   `src/app/(sub pages)/sportsGalaxy/`
    *   `src/app/(sub pages)/techGalaxy/`
    *   The corresponding component folders in `src/components/`.
    *   The old `ItemLayout.jsx` files.
