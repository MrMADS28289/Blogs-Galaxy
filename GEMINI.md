### Pending Tasks:

### Completed Tasks:
- Addressed the "like" issue in `BlogCard.jsx` by using the actual user token for authentication and implementing local state management for the likes count.
- Addressed the "comment" issue in `CommentsModal.jsx` by using the authenticated user's name/email as the author and including the authorization token when submitting comments.
- Refactored API calls in `BlogCard.jsx` to use `src/utils/blogApi.js` for `likeBlog` and `fetchComments` functions.
- Solved the `400 Bad Request` error for the `/api/blogs/:id/rate` endpoint by correcting the request body from `value: 1` to `stars: 1` in `Blogs-Galaxy/src/utils/blogApi.js`.
- Implemented persistence for blog likes by modifying `blogs-galaxy-backend/controllers/blogController.js` to update the `likes` field in the `Blog` model using `findByIdAndUpdate` and by updating `Blogs-Galaxy/src/components/BlogCard.jsx` to re-fetch blog data after a like operation.
- Added `fetchBlogById` function to `Blogs-Galaxy/src/utils/blogApi.js`.
- Implemented full like/unlike functionality, including updating the `Blog` model with a `likedBy` array, modifying `blogController.js` to manage `likedBy` and `likes` count, and updating `BlogCard.jsx` and `blogApi.js` to send and receive the correct like/unlike status.
