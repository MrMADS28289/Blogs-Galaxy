## Current Task:

### Sound Component Modal

**What:**

- A modal dialog (`Modal` component) is displayed to the user.
- It asks the user if they would like to play background music.

**Why:**

- **User Consent:** To comply with autoplay policies of browsers and provide a good user experience, explicit user consent is requested before playing audio.
- **Persistence:** The user's choice (to play or not play music) is stored in `localStorage` for 3 days, so they are not prompted on every visit within that period.

**How:**

- **`useState` for `showModal`:** The `Sound` component uses a `showModal` state variable to control the visibility of the modal.
- **`useEffect` for Consent Check:**
  - On component mount, `useEffect` checks `localStorage` for `musicConsent` and `consentTime`.
  - If valid consent exists (within 3 days), the music is played or not played based on the stored preference.
  - If no valid consent or autoplay is prevented, `setShowModal(true)` is called to display the modal.
- **`createPortal`:** The `Modal` component is rendered using `createPortal` to ensure it's mounted directly under `document.body` (specifically, `document.getElementById("my-modal")`), which helps with z-indexing and avoids styling conflicts with parent components.
- **User Interaction:**
  - Clicking "Yes" calls the `toggle` function, which starts/pauses the music, updates `isPlaying` state, saves the consent to `localStorage`, and hides the modal.
  - Clicking "No" calls `onClose`, which simply hides the modal without playing music.
- **Autoplay Handling:** If autoplay is prevented by the browser, event listeners for user interaction (`click`, `keydown`, `touchstart`) are added to attempt playback on the first user interaction.
