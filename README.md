    ```
3.  **Firebase Configuration:**
    *   Create a Firebase project in the Firebase Console.
    *   Set up Firestore Database and Firebase Authentication.
    *   Create a `.env.local` file in the root of the project and add your Firebase configuration:
        ```
        NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your_api_key
        NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your_auth_domain
        NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id
        NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your_storage_bucket
        NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=your_messaging_sender_id
        NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_APP_ID=your_app_id
        NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MEASUREMENT_ID=your_measurement_id
        ```

### Running the Development Server

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

## Future Improvements & Roadmap

Based on current analysis, the following areas are identified for enhancement:

*   **Security:** Migrate authentication token storage from `localStorage` to more secure HTTP-only cookies to mitigate XSS risks.
*   **TypeScript Adoption:**
    *   Enforce strict type checking by setting `"strict": true` in `tsconfig.json`.
    *   Migrate all `.js` and `.jsx` files to `.tsx` to fully leverage TypeScript's benefits for improved code quality and maintainability.
*   **Performance Optimization:**
    *   Ensure `next/image` components consistently include `width` and `height` props to prevent layout shifts.
    *   Implement virtualization for long lists (e.g., comments) to enhance rendering performance.
    *   Strategically apply `React.memo`, `useCallback`, and `useMemo` to minimize unnecessary component re-renders.
*   **Code Structure & Readability:**
    *   Centralize API error handling into a single utility function to reduce code duplication and improve consistency.
    *   Refactor complex logic from component event handlers into dedicated, focused functions.
    *   Strive for consistent API response structures from the backend for easier data handling.
*   **Best Practices:** Enhance ESLint configuration with additional plugins for accessibility, React Hooks, and other best practices.
