Key areas for improvement, prioritized by impact:

1.  Critical Security Vulnerability: Immediately address storing authentication tokens in `localStorage`. This is highly insecure
    due to XSS risks. Migrate to HTTP-only cookies for token storage.
2.  TypeScript Adoption:
    - Change "strict": false to "strict": true in tsconfig.json to enforce robust type checking.
    - Migrate all .js and .jsx files to .tsx to fully leverage TypeScript's benefits.
3.  Performance & Optimization:
    - Ensure next/image components always have width and height props to prevent layout shifts.
    - Consider virtualization for long lists (e.g., comments) to improve rendering performance.
    - Strategically use React.memo, useCallback, and useMemo to prevent unnecessary re-renders.
4.  Code Structure & Readability:
    - Centralize API error handling into a single utility function to reduce repetition.
    - Extract complex logic from component event handlers into separate, focused functions.
    - Aim for consistent API response structures from your backend.
5.  Best Practices: Enhance ESLint configuration with additional plugins (e.g., for accessibility, React Hooks).

Overall, you've built a feature-rich application. Addressing these points, especially the security and TypeScript aspects, will
significantly enhance its robustness, maintainability, and scalability.
